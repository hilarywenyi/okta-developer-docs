To add the SDK to your app, include the following dependency in your `app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'com.okta.android:okta-idx-kotlin:$okta_sdk_version'
```

where `$okta.sdk.version` is the latest release version. See [Release Status](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-android/tags) for the latest Identity Engine Kotlin SDK version.
